Step by Step guide for mongodb

MongoDB Step-By-Step
Introduction
-	Document oriented NO-SQL Database
-	Schema FREE database
-	Composed of Binay JSON
-	It has Collection (Group of docs)
-	Open Source
MongoDB vs RDBMS
-	Collection versus Table
-	Document versus rows
-	Fields versus columns
-	No restrictions on type of collection as its schema-free
Setup on Windows
-	Download mongodb.msi
-	Install in C:mongo
-	Route to C:\mongo\bin 
-	Open command prompt
-	Run mongod command (mongo daemon thread)
-	Open another terminal then run mongo command which will take us to mongodb terminal
-	Run show dbs to see all the databases previously installed on our machines
Create Database and Drop Database
-	show dbs : list all databases
-	use mydb : creates new database if not present and takes us inside this database mydb 
-	db : let us know in which database we currently reside in
-	db.mycollection.insert({“key” : “value”}) : creates new collection mycollection if not present already 
-	use mydb and then db.dropDatabse() : will drop the current database
Create Collection and Drop Collection
-	use mydb : creates new database mydb and switched into mydb
-	db.createCollection(“myCollection”, <options/optional>) : creates new collection as myCollection
-	show collections : list all collections in db
-	db.mycollection2.insert({“key” : “value”}) : another method to create new collection as mycollection2
-	show collections : list both the collections inside db
-	db.myCollection.drop() : drops the collection myCollection
-	show collections : would now list only 1 collection and i.e mycollection2
Insert and Update Query 
-	use school : create a new database named as school
-	db.students.insert([
-	  {
-	    "studentNo": "1",
-	    "name": "AAA",
-	    "age": 10
-	  },
-	  {
-	    "studentNo": "2",
-	    "name": "BBB",
-	    "age": 15
-	  },
-	  {
-	    "studentNo": "3",
-	    "name": "CCC",
-	    "age": 8
-	  },
-	  {
-	    "studentNo": "4",
-	    "name": "DDD",
-	    "age": 12
-	  },
-	  {
-	    "studentNo": "4",
-	    "name": "EEE",
-	    "age": 20
-	  }
-	])
-	show collections : would list students collections
-	db.students.find() : would give collection table/json view
-	db.students.findOne() : would return first object in students collection 
-	{
-	    "studentNo": "1",
-	    "name": "AAA",
-	    "age": 10
-	  }
-	db.students.find({“studentNo” : “2”}) would return
-	{
-	    "studentNo": "2",
-	    "name": "BBB",
-	    "age": 15
-	  },
-	db.students.find({"age" : {$gte : 12}}) : would give all the students whose age is greater than or equal to 12
Query using AND OR conditions
-	db.students.find() : would list all the collection
 
-	AND operation :
-	db.students.find(
-		{"name" : "BBB" , "age" : 15}
-	)  comma in the above example would act as AND operation and can be read as Find a student whose name is BBB AND age is 15
 

OR operation:

-	db.students.find({
-		$or : [{"studentNo" : "2"}, {"name" : "DDD"}]
-	})
-	$or : used for OR operator and followed by : [{} , {}] list of params to ORed with
-	Can be read as get Query for students whose studentNo is 2 OR name is DDD
 

AND OR operations
-	Query for student whose name is CCC AND whose age is 8 OR 12
 

Update Document
-	Update command can be used while edit in particular data
Before update : 
 

-	db.students.update(
-		{ "_id" : ObjectId("5868b1b54580db15ffba3e8f")},
-		{$set : {"name" : "Rob"}}
-	)
-	In the above query we use $set to modify/update the record which matches to the id 
-	Can be read as update the name of student whose name was mark to Rob whose id is 5868b1b54580db15ffba3e8f – this id is auto-generated by mongodb to assign unique id to every record
 

Update multiple
-	Will update multiple records at a time
-	Since last 2 records have same studentNo and we need to edit/update their lastNames to Winterfell, this can be achieved by setting {multi: true} and can be viewed as 
 

Create New Record:
-	db.students.save(
-		{"_id" : ObjectId("5868b1b54580db15ffba3e95"), "studentNo" : "7", "name" : "Theon", "age" : 20, "lastName" : "Gray"}
-	)
-	When we give new id and followed by all the new data, this will create/update collection with new entry
 

Delete Document

-	db.students.remove(<enter particular parameter id or something>)
-	if we do not enter parameters inside remove(), this would remove all the entries and empty the collection 
-	in this case , db.students.remove(
-		{"_id" : ObjectId("5868b1b54580db15ffba3e94")}
-	) will remove data with id 5868b1b54580db15ffba3e94
-	If we want to remove multiple entries with same parameters based on their ages we can specify that with {“age”, 20} and so on
 
Mongodb Projection
-	Projection means show only necessary data from the document rather than showing the entire document
-	db.students.find({}, {"name": 1}), in this case, inside find() keep the first argument as {} and second argument would be {KEY_From_document : Boolean } 
-	Boolean 1 means we want to show
-	Boolean 0 means we want to hide
-	In this example it would be db.students.find({}, {"name": 1, “_id” : 0}) and output can be viewed as 
 

Limit, Skip and Sort collection
Limit
-	Limits the doc to the number specified in limit()
-	In this case limits to 3 records in doc
 
And this will output as 
 
Skip
-	Skips the records as per the number specified in skip(<number>)
-	In this case, it will skip first 3 records
 
This will output as
 

Sort
-	Sorts the data in ascending or descending order as per mentioned in Sort({“KEY” : 1})
-	KEY : sort on mentioned key
-	1 : ascending 
-	-1 : descending 
-	In this example sort({“name” : 1}) will sort on names in ascending order
 
This will output as,
